			<div class="accordion-header"><div>Why is this product more advanced than others in the category of stress relief or CBD formulations?</div></div>
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>Omax Sleep & Stress Remedy provides a three-part therapeutic solution through its unique fusion of specialty ingredients: Patented ProResolv™ Omega-3 formula rich with polyunsaturated fatty acids to support optimal inflammatory response, Hemp Oil CBD to support higher levels of stress-relieving endocannabinoids, and AlphaWave® L-Theanine to support increased focus. This patented multi-mode formula promotes a sense of calm and relief unmatched by CBD alone.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>Is Hemp the same as Marijuana? </div></div>
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>No. Hemp and marijuana come from the same plant called Cannabis sativa L. but are cultivated differently. Both hemp and marijuana have CBD, but they are distinct in their concentrations of THC. Marijuana is highly concentrated in THC, which causes psychoactive effects. Contrastingly, hemp, unlike marijuana, has virtually no THC (0.3% or less) and therefore, does not produce psychoactive effects. Omax Sleep & Stress Remedy uses legally-compliant industrial hemp as its CBD source.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>What are phytocannabinoids?</div></div>
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>Phytocannabinoids are molecular compounds found naturally in the Cannabis sativa L. plant. There are 113 known phytocannabinoids found in both hemp and marijuana. CBD and THC are two such key phytocannabinoids. On a molecular level, CBD from hemp and CBD from marijuana are equally therapeutic. However, the difference in THC concentration enables CBD from hemp to be purely therapeutic and non-psychoactive.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>Will Omax Sleep & Stress Remedy get me “high?”</div></div>
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>The ingredients in Omax Sleep & Stress Remedy will not get you high. CBD does not bind to brain receptors in the same manner THC does and will not give psychoactive effects. Our unique formula contains less than 0.3% THC.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>How do you determine the purity and the quantity of the CBD in your product?</div></div>
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>The purity of CBD in Omax Sleep & Stress Remedy is guaranteed through many tests and checkpoints before it arrives to the customer. Our commitment to quality includes the use of chemical-free CO2 extraction in addition to third-party testing. We also have Certificates of Analysis for potency assurance. </p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>What part of the hemp plant does CBD come from? </div></div>
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>Our CBD oil is derived from the stalks and stems of hemp plants.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>Where does your hemp oil come from?</div></div>
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>Our CBD from hemp oil is European Sourced and Farmed (from Belgium) and EU Certified for quality.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>What is the meaning of “full-spectrum” in “full-spectrum CBD”?</div></div>
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>Full-spectrum CBD, also known as whole-plant CBD, indicates that the CBD contains all the additional healing and therapeutic benefits found in the plant. CBD offers the most benefits of the cannabinoids; however, there is a synergistic benefit to combining them together – consider it the “entourage effect.”</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>How are your oils processed? </div></div>
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>To meet the highest standards in producing Omax Sleep & Stress Remedy, Omax full-spectrum hemp oil and Omega-3 oils go through chemical-free, CO2 supercritical extraction to ensure they are concentrated without harsh chemicals or solvents and remain of superior potency. </p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>What are the benefits of using CBD?</div></div>
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>CBD has unique beneficial effects on the body’s ECS (Endocannabinoid System), and we recommend it for improved overall wellness. In accordance with federal regulations, we cannot make specific health claims regarding dietary supplement products.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>Can this product help with pain? </div></div>
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>Omax Sleep & Stress Remedy is formulated to target stress relief; however, you may also notice some reduction in general aches and pains due to the patented ProResolv® Omega-3 which can help support optimal inflammation response in the body.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>How much CBD is in the product, and how often should I take it? How soon will I feel it?</div></div>
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>Each softgel contains 5 mg of CBD. We recommend starting with one softgel per day with food. Increase dosage as needed until desired result is achieved. For improvements in sleep, take in the evening approximately 2-3 hours before desired sleep time. Each person is different, and the effects of CBD are unique to everyone.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>How should I take it to have the best result?</div></div>
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>For stress relief, we suggest taking your supplement in the morning with food. For better sleep, we suggest taking it in the evening before bedtime with a light snack. Foods that are higher in healthy fats, such as a handful of nuts or some full-fat yogurt, can help improve absorption and bioavailability of CBD. </p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>Can I take too much?</div></div>
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>As each person’s endocannabinoid system is different, we recommend starting with one softgel (5 mg CBD) and gradually increasing until you find your desired daily dose.  Use the same dose for a few days. Observe the effects and adjust the dosage if necessary. Please consult with your physician if you are or will be undergoing treatment for a medical condition, are pregnant, lactating or taking any over the counter or prescription medications.  </p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>Is it safe?</div></div>
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>All of the ingredients in Omax Sleep & Stress Remedy are FDS GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe). As a general rule, please consult with your physician before using any dietary supplement, including hemp extract supplements. </p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>What is the shelf life? How should I store it?</div></div>
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>Omax Sleep & Stress Remedy will stay fresh for up to two years from the manufacture date if stored in a cool, dry place or in the refrigerator. The expiration date is printed on the packaging.</p></div>
