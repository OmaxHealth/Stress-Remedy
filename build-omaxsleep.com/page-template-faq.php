			<div class="accordion-header"><div>Why is this product more advanced than others in the category of stress relief or sleep formulas?</div></div>	
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>MAX SLEEP provides a three-part therapeutic solution through its unique fusion of specialty ingredients: Patented ProResolv™ Omega-3 formula rich with polyunsaturated fatty acids to support optimal inflammatory response, Full-spectrum hemp oil to support higher levels of stress-relieving endocannabinoids, and AlphaWave® L-Theanine to support relaxation. This patented multi-mode formula promotes a sense of calm and relief unmatched by other sleep products.</p></div>

			<div class="accordion-header"><div>Is Hemp the same as Marijuana?</div></div>	
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>No. Hemp and marijuana come from the same plant called Cannabis sativa L. but are cultivated differently. Marijuana is highly concentrated in THC, which causes psychoactive effects. Contrastingly, hemp, unlike marijuana, has virtually no THC and therefore, does not produce psychoactive effects. MAX SLEEP uses legally-compliant industrial hemp so there are no negative side effects.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>Will MAX SLEEP get me “high?”</div></div>	
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>The ingredients in MAX SLEEP will not get you high. But you may experience a relaxed blissful feeling!</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>How do you determine the purity and the quantity of the hemp in your product?</div></div>	
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>The purity of full-spectrum hemp in MAX SLEEP is guaranteed through many tests and checkpoints before it arrives to the customer. Our commitment to quality includes the use of chemical-free CO2 extraction in addition to third-party testing. We also have Certificates of Analysis for potency assurance.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>What part of the hemp plant do you use?</div></div>	
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>Our full-spectrum hemp oil is derived from the stalks and stems of hemp plants.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>Where does your hemp oil come from?</div></div>	
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>Our hemp is European sourced and farmed (from Belgium) and EU Certified for quality.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>What is the meaning of “full-spectrum”?</div></div>	
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>Full-spectrum indicates that the hemp plant contains all the additional healing and therapeutic benefits found in the plant.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>How are your oils processed?</div></div>	
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>To meet the highest standards in producing MAX SLEEP, Omax full-spectrum hemp oil and Omega-3 oils go through chemical-free, CO2 supercritical extraction to ensure they are concentrated without harsh chemicals or solvents and remain of superior potency.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>Can this product help with pain?</div></div>	
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>MAX SLEEP is formulated to target stress relief; however, you may also notice some reduction in general aches and pains due to the patented ProResolv® Omega-3 which can help support optimal inflammation response in the body.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>How often should I take it? How soon will I feel it?</div></div>	
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>Each softgel contains 5 mg of phytocannabinoids. We recommend starting with one softgel per day with food. Increase dosage as needed until desired result is achieved. For improvements in sleep, take in the evening approximately 2-3 hours before desired sleep time. Each person is different, and the effects of phytocannabinoids are unique to everyone.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>How should I take it to have the best result?</div></div>	
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>For stress relief, we suggest taking your supplement in the morning with food. For better sleep, we suggest taking it in the evening before bedtime with a light snack. Foods that are higher in healthy fats, such as a handful of nuts or some full-fat yogurt, can help improve absorption and bioavailability.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>Can I take too much?</div></div>	
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>As each person’s endocannabinoid system is different, we recommend starting with one softgel (5 mg phytocannabinoids) and gradually increasing until you find your desired daily dose.  Use the same dose for a few days. Observe the effects and adjust the dosage if necessary. Please consult with your physician if you are or will be undergoing treatment for a medical condition, are pregnant, lactating or taking any over the counter or prescription medications.</p></div>
			
			<div class="accordion-header"><div>What is the shelf life? How should I store it?</div></div>	
			<div class="accordion-content"><p>MAX SLEEP will stay fresh for up to two years from the manufacture date if stored in a cool, dry place or in the refrigerator. The expiration date is printed on the packaging.</p></div>
