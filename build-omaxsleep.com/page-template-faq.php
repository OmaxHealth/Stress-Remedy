			<div class="accordion-header"><div>What's in Omax Sleep & Stress Remedy?</div></div>

			<div class="accordion-content"><p>For improving sleep quality, we recommend starting with two softgels about 2-3 hours before bedtime with a light snack. The formula is designed to naturally relax your body and mind, so you can wind down gently.  Foods that are higher in healthy fats, such as a handful of nuts or some full-fat yogurt, can help improve absorption and bio availability.</p></div>

Sleep & Stress Remedy uses legally-compliant industrial hemp so there are no negative side effects.</p></div>
